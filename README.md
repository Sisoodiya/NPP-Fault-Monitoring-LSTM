# NPP Fault Monitoring System - Source Code

This directory contains the clean, organized source code for the NPP Fault Monitoring System.

## üìÅ File Structure

### Core Modules
- **`models.py`** - All neural network model architectures (CNN-LSTM, Enhanced, Large-scale, Ultra-large)
- **`features.py`** - Feature extraction functions (statistical features, WKS, entropy, etc.)
- **`utils.py`** - Utility functions for data processing and visualisation
- **`data_preprocessing.py`** - Data preprocessing and windowing functions

### Training Scripts
- **`train_basic_cnn_lstm.py`** - Train the basic CNN-LSTM model with backpropagation
- **`train_enhanced_cnn_lstm.py`** - Train the enhanced CNN-LSTM model with attention mechanisms
- **`train_large_scale_models.py`** - Train large-scale models (11M and 37M parameters)
- **`train_siao_optimization.py`** - Train models using SIAO optimization

### Optimization
- **`siao_optimizer.py`** - SIAO (Self Aquila Optimization) implementation
